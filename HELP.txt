USAGE:

    migrate
    migrate:main
        Executes the set of migrations that have yet to be run.

    migrate:make $migration_name
        Creates a new migration.

        The `$migration_name` param defines the name of the migration.
        This should be descriptive of what the migration intends to
        accomplish.

    migrate:rollback
        Rolls back all of the migrations that have been run in the
        database.

    migrate:refresh
        Rolls back all of the migrations that have been run in the
        database, then runs all of the migrations in the database.

        The same end result would occur if you run this command vs
        running `rollback` followed by a `migrate`.

    migrate:map
        Displays the current state of the migrations.

    migrate:step $increment
        Allows the user to step through their migrations.

        The `$increment` param defines the number and direction
        of steps.  To migrate, this parameter should be +X, where
        X is the number of migrations to run.  To revert, this
        parameter should be -Y, where Y is the number of migrations
        to revert.
